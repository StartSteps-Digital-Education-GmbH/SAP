### Practical Tips for Your Daily Routine

- **Plan 4 hours every afternoon** for Coursera (14:00–18:00), and add an extra **hour in the morning session** on 2–3 days if you’re behind.  
- Try to **complete at least one module/section per day** in Coursera so you keep momentum.  
- After each Coursera session, take **2–3 minutes** to write one sentence:  
  > “How did what I learned this afternoon connect to this morning’s lesson?”
- If you miss a day, spread the missed time across the rest of the week (e.g. +30–45 minutes on three other days) rather than trying to catch up all at once.

You don’t need to worry about the exact hours for each course – if you follow the weekly targets above and work steadily each afternoon, you will be on track to finish the Coursera certificate on time.
