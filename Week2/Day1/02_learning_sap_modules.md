# Day 1 (Monday): SAP Modules and Functional Knowledge
## Functional vs Technical Modules and Industry Applications

In this session you will see how SAP organizes its solutions into **functional** and **technical** modules, look at one functional example (CRM), and see how SAP supports **industry-specific** needs (Retail, Healthcare, Automotive).

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:
- ✅ Explain the difference between functional and technical SAP modules
- ✅ Describe CRM as an example of a functional module (components, functionalities, elements)
- ✅ Name at least three industry-specific SAP solutions and what they focus on
- ✅ Match a simple business need to the right type of module or industry solution

## Part 1: Two Types of SAP Modules

SAP modules are often grouped into two categories:

| | **Functional modules** | **Technical modules** |
|---|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Focus** | Specific business processes and operations | Development, integration, system administration |
| **Examples** | Finance, HR, Sales, CRM, Procurement | ABAP development, integration, system monitoring |
| **Who uses them** | Business users, process experts | Developers, IT, system admins |
| **Question they answer** | “How do we run our business processes?” | “How do we build, connect, and run the system?” |

### Mini Activity: Which Type?

- **“We need to run payroll and recruit new staff.”** → _________________ (functional / technical)
- **“We need to connect SAP to our warehouse system.”** → _________________ (functional / technical)

## Part 2: Example – Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

**CRM** = Managing relationships with customers (sales, marketing, service).

### Components (building blocks)

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Sales Force Automation** | Manages sales processes, opportunities, and pipelines |
| **Marketing** | Plans and runs marketing campaigns |
| **Service** | Manages customer service and support |
| **Interaction Center** | Handles customer interactions across channels (phone, email, chat) |
| **Field Service Management** | Manages service delivery in the field (e.g. technicians) |

### Functionalities (what the system can do)

- Customer data management  
- Sales and service automation  
- Marketing campaign management  

### Elements (data and objects)

- **Customer accounts** – information on customers and their interactions  
- **Service tickets** – records of customer service requests  
- **Campaigns** – marketing initiatives and promotions  

### Practical application

- Better customer relationships and satisfaction  
- More efficient sales and service processes  
- Better tracking and effectiveness of marketing

## Part 3: Technical Modules – Short Overview

**Technical modules** focus on:

- **Development** – e.g. programming (ABAP), building apps  
- **Integration** – connecting SAP to other systems  
- **System administration** – keeping the system running, secure, and performant  

We will go deeper into technical topics later in the week; for now it is enough to know they are the “how we build and run the system” side.

## Part 4: Industry-Specific Applications

SAP offers **industry solutions** – tailored for specific sectors.

### Match the industry to the focus (fill in or check)

| Industry | Main focus (examples) |
|----------|------------------------|
| **SAP for Retail** | Inventory management, point-of-sale (POS), customer experience |
| **SAP for Healthcare** | Patient care, operations, financial management, regulatory compliance |
| **SAP for Automotive** | Supply chain, production planning, vehicle lifecycle management |

**Your turn:** A hospital wants to improve patient care and meet regulations. Which industry solution is most relevant?
