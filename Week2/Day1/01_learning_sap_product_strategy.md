## Part 1: What Is SAP Product Strategy?

**SAP product strategy** is the set of development and marketing plans for SAP’s products so they meet **market demands** and **technology trends**.

In simple terms: SAP decides *what* to build, *when* to improve it, and *how* to offer it to customers.

## Part 2: Components of SAP Product Strategy

SAP (and most product companies) use four main building blocks:

| Component | What it means | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Product Roadmap** | Long-term plan for product development and enhancements | “Next year we will add AI-based forecasting to SAP S/4HANA.” |
| **Market Analysis** | Understanding customer needs and market trends | “Manufacturing companies need better supply chain visibility.” |
| **Innovation** | Using new technologies (e.g. AI, ML, IoT) in products | “SAP is adding machine learning to finance and logistics.” |
| **Customer Feedback** | Using feedback to improve products | “Customers asked for simpler reporting – we improved the analytics app.” |

### Think About It

**Why would SAP care about “customer feedback” in its strategy?**

## Part 3: Functional Knowledge – What Does It Mean?

In SAP, **functional knowledge** means understanding **business processes and how SAP supports them**, not only technical installation or programming.

### Three Main Areas

**1. ERP Systems**
- **ERP** = Enterprise Resource Planning: software that helps companies manage core business areas (finance, HR, sales, procurement, etc.) in one system.
- **Functional knowledge** here = knowing what finance, HR, or sales *do* in the company and how SAP supports those processes.

**2. Cross-Functional Integration**
- Different SAP modules (Finance, Sales, HR, etc.) work together.
- **Functional knowledge** = understanding how data and processes flow *between* these areas (e.g. a sale in Sales creates an invoice in Finance).

**3. Industry Solutions**
- SAP offers **industry-specific** solutions (e.g. for automotive, retail, healthcare).
- **Functional knowledge** = knowing the typical processes and needs of an industry and how SAP addresses them.

### Think About It

**Give one example of “cross-functional” in a company: two departments that must work together.**
