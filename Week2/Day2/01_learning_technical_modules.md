# Day 2 (Tuesday): Technical Modules
## Development, Integration, and System Administration in SAP

Yesterday you covered up to **slide 11** (functional modules and CRM). **Today we start from slide 12:** **Technical Modules** – the side of SAP that focuses on building, connecting, and running the system.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:
- ✅ Explain what technical modules in SAP are
- ✅ Name the three main technical focus areas: development, integration, system administration
- ✅ Give simple examples of each area
- ✅ See how technical and functional modules work together (e.g. in industry solutions)

---

## 📌 Recap

- **Day 1:** SAP product strategy, functional knowledge, functional vs technical modules, CRM example, industry applications (Retail, Healthcare, Automotive).
- **Today:** Technical modules in more detail, then enterprise systems environment and digital transformation.

## Part 1: What Are Technical Modules?

**Technical modules** focus on the **technical aspects** of SAP systems:

- **Development** – building and changing programs and applications (e.g. ABAP, apps)
- **Integration** – connecting SAP to other systems (other SAP systems, non-SAP software, cloud services)
- **System administration** – keeping the system running, secure, and performant (monitoring, backups, user access, upgrades)

In short: **functional** = *what* the business does (finance, sales, HR); **technical** = *how* the system is built, connected, and operated.

## Part 2: Three Main Areas

| Area | What it does | Simple example |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Development** | Creating and changing software: custom reports, apps, extensions to standard SAP | A company needs a special report in SAP – developers build it using ABAP or other tools. |
| **Integration** | Connecting SAP with other systems so data and processes flow between them | SAP needs to talk to the warehouse system – integration connects them (e.g. via APIs, middleware). |
| **System administration** | Installing, configuring, monitoring, and maintaining the SAP system | IT monitors system performance, applies updates, and manages who can access which transactions. |

### Think About It

**Why can’t a company use only “functional” modules without “technical” (e.g. integration or administration)?**

## Part 3: How Technical and Functional Work Together

**Industry-specific solutions** (e.g. SAP for Retail, Healthcare, Automotive) use **both**:

- **Functional** – industry processes (e.g. POS in retail, patient care in healthcare, supply chain in automotive).
- **Technical** – development (custom apps), integration (with stores, medical devices, suppliers), and administration (security, performance).

So when we say “SAP for Retail” or “SAP for Healthcare,” we mean both the business (functional) and the technical side (development, integration, administration) working together.

## 🎉 Key Takeaways

- **Technical modules** = development, integration, system administration.
- **Development** = building and changing programs and apps.
